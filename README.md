## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You need a web browser and a code editor. No complex setup is required to run the frontend.

### Installation

1.  Clone the repo:
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/Debojit991/TrialMatch.git]
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd TrialMatch-Plus
    ```
3.  Configure Firebase:
This project uses Firebase for its backend. You'll need to create your own Firebase project to run it.

Go to the Firebase Console and create a new project.

Add a new "Web App" to your project.

Find your Firebase configuration keys (apiKey, authDomain, etc.).

In the project's root directory, create a new file named firebase-config.js.

Paste your configuration into this file like so:

JavaScript
```sh
// firebase-config.js
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
  messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
  appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"
};
```
Finally, make sure your index.html file has a script tag pointing to this new file before the main script.js file:

HTML
```sh
<script src="firebase-config.js"></script>
<script src="script.js"></script>
```
Launch the App:
Simply open the index.html file in your web browser. You're all set

## üìñ How to Use

1.  **Open the Application:** Launch `index.html`.
2.  **Sign Up:** Create an account as either a "Patient" or a "Doctor".
3.  **Complete Your Profile:**
    * **Patients:** Fill in your Date of Birth to enable age-based eligibility checks.
    * **Doctors:** Fill in your specialization and location to provide context for your trials.
4.  **Explore:**
    * **Patients:** Use the filters to find trials. Save trials to your list and compare them.
    * **Doctors:** Navigate to your dashboard to add a new trial or manage existing ones. View patient leads who have shown interest.

## üìÇ Project Structure

The code is organized into three main files for clarity and maintainability:

* **`index.html`**: Contains the complete HTML structure and all UI elements for the application, including modals and both patient/doctor views.
* **`style.css`**: Holds all the styling rules, including variables for themes (light/dark mode), animations, glassmorphism effects, and responsive design media queries.
* **`script.js`**: The core of the application's logic. It handles:
    * Firebase initialization and all backend communication (Auth & Firestore).
    * DOM manipulation and event handling.
    * State management for users, trials, and favorites.
    * All feature logic (filtering, saving, comparing, PDF export, etc.).
